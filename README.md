# EL6 Load Testing

EL6 is a custom API load testing tool built with TypeScript, designed to simulate high request rates (e.g., 450 requests per second) without relying on external load testing packages like k6

# Motivation

The goal is to enable continuous code execution without being limited by a specific duration, as seen with K6. While K6 is a powerful load testing tool, it tends to consume a significant amount of memory during extended runs. This can lead to resource inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining performance over long periods. My aim is to create a solution that is resource-efficient and capable of sustained execution, making it more suitable for scenarios where long-term reliability and scalability are essential.
